#IoT Projects (for fun :joy:)

This repository is for my IoT projects. I make this projects for fun and learning. 

## List of projects 

* LED : 
This project is simple. It connects to a WiFi network, initializes a http server, then 
you can control a LED using these requests :

```
/on 
``` 

This turns LED on . 

```
/off
```

This turns LED off. 

```
/blink
```

This turns LED on & off each 0.5 second. 

```
/double
```
This is a double blink for 0.1 second, and a 0.5 waiting time.
